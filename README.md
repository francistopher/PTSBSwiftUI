# Periodic Table Study Buddy iOS Swift (Alpha)

- Arriving to an App Store near you!

## Prologue

I was living with my parents while the pandemic was roaring. I and my bored brain, decided to give mobile development a shot, with the help of the google search bar. I taught myself just enough Swift to create an iOS app using the UIKit framework. I stumbled upon the SwiftUI framework in 2021, I had no idea about it. I decided to program a mobile app that examines your knowledge of the Periodic Table to help lay the foundation of self studying chemistry and to learn about the SwiftUI framework.

## To do

- Comment code
- Write testcases
- Update codebase for MacOS support
